## Execution

####Run the LeNet Model

		a)Run the LeNet.ipynb file in Anaconda environment(Jupyter notebook) or Google collab.

		b)Provided the valid path of the train test and validation folder in the required block
		for this open the Data_set folder and then Mnist and then you can see the Train,Test and 
		validation folder.

		c)For testing the accuracy for different percentage of noise you can open the folder 
		Test_va which contain Test folder with various percentage of noises for example Test10
		contain folder containing 10 percent noise.

####Run the ResNet Model
		a)Run the ResNet.ipynb file in Anaconda environment(Jupyter notebook) or Google collab.

		b)Specify the path of the resnet weight provided in the code folder which is my_model_weights.h5. 

		c)Provided the valid path of the train, test and validation folder in the required block
		for this open the Data_set folder and then Mnist and then you can see the Train,Test and 
		validation folder.

		d)For testing the accuracy for different percentage of noise you can open the folder 
		Test_va which contain Test folder with various percentage of noises for example Test10
		contain folder containing 10 percent noise.


####Run the comparison Graph
		a)Run the Graph Comparison.ipynb file in Anaconda environment(Jupyter notebook) or Google
		 collab with the accuracy that you have got during evaluation.
		
#######NOTE:For running the code on Google colab first upload the Data_set folder provided in your Google Drive
		and then mount it in Google Colab.#####
